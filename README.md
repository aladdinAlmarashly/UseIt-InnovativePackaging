# Use It - Innovative Packaging

## Overview
'Use It' presents an innovative approach to packaging with a focus on sustainability and consumer engagement. Developed by Omar Al Marashly, Aladdin Almarashly, and Aziz Marashly, our project currently serves as a proof of principle for reading barcodes and providing standardized information.

## About the Project
Our prototype is designed to read barcodes on various packaging materials and deliver relevant product information. This proof of principle stage aims to demonstrate the feasibility and potential of our broader vision to integrate Laser QR Codes into packaging, promoting a more informed and environmentally conscious consumer behavior.

## Prototype Features
- **Barcode Reading:** Efficiently reads barcodes on different packaging materials.
- **Information Delivery:** Provides consistent product information upon barcode scanning.
- **Proof of Principle:** Demonstrates the initial step towards our ultimate goal of integrating Laser QR Codes for comprehensive product insights.

## How It Works
The prototype uses a barcode scanning technology to read codes on products. Upon successful scanning, it retrieves and displays standardized information about the product. This process serves as the foundational technology for our planned Laser QR Code integration.

## Future Goals
- Integrate Laser QR Codes into packaging materials.
- Offer enhanced, detailed product information through QR code scanning.
- Foster sustainable consumer practices by promoting recycling and responsible usage.
